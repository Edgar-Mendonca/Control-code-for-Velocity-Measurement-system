# Control-code-for-Velocity-Measurement-system
The Velocity Measurement System is based on two adjacent infrared barriers that measure the time delay between two sensors.  The system comprises a 16x2 LCD which displays the time difference (us) and velocity (m/s).
The code requires ARDUINO IDE software to run.
